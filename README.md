# Checkpoint-Processing-Recovery-Implementation


1. Implemented coarse-grain retirement and aggressive register reclamation to establish an expansive instruction window size with a smaller Physical Register File (PRF). 
2. Developed periodic checkpoints for checkpoint-based recovery. 
3. The CPR approach demonstrates higher IPC efficiency with a reduced PRF size, with negligible IPC impact observed with further PRF size increases.
